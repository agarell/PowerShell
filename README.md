Here you can find a collection of Powershell scripts I have made for a varity of purposes. 

1) [Warranty Claim Auto Emailer ](https://github.com/agarell/PowerShell/blob/main/AutoEmail_Public.ps1)
   This app creates an email in the background to send on your behalf. The only details you have to put in are the service number and date to be collected, the script handles the rest.
